## Description
It's a tool to help web developers by either generating filler text, creating random users, or both.

## Demo
I will do my demo during section.

## Details for teaching team
* Lorem ipsum is boring, so I created a class to create filler text composed of silly, cute, and most likely ungrammatical sentences.
* My classes, CuteUser.php and CuteFiller.php can be found in app/models.

## Outside code
* Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/
* Google font: http://google.com/fonts
